        Now, more than ever, we are aware of how important exercise is to our overall health and wellbeing. 
        Over 60 million Americans were running for exercise in 2017. Running is not a new thing, it’s been 
        around since the beginning of time. It remains one of the most common forms of physical activity 
        for us because, to put it honestly, it’s free! No gym membership, online activity fee, exercise DVD 
        to purchase; you just get out and do it! There is one important form of equipment that you do need to 
        run effectively, for protection for your feet, knees, back, legs and joints: GOOD running shoes! 
        Are the shoes you wear while running really all that important? You better believe they are! 
        Good running shoes don’t come cheap but are proven to be worth the money. How can you justify paying $80
        and up for a shoe that will hit pavement, dirt, mud and muck? Lets take a look at some of the most popular
        running shoe brands and learn about their brand, brand history, and take an honest look at some of their 
        products!
