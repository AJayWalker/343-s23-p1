        Brand History
    </h2>
    <p>
        Brooks Sports, Inc., also known as Brooks Running, is an American sports equipment company that designs and 
        markets high-performance men's and women's sneakers, clothing, and accessories. Headquartered in Seattle, 
        Washington, Brooks products are available in 60 countries worldwide. It is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.
        Brooks, founded in 1914, originally manufactured shoes for a broad range of sports. "White hot" in the mid-70s, 
        the company faltered in the latter part of the decade, and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1981. 
        In 2001, the product line was cut by more than 50% to focus the brand solely on running, and its concentration 
        on performance technology was increased. Brooks Running became the top selling brand in the specialty running 
        shoe market in 2011, and remained so through 2017 with a 25% market share. Brooks shoes have been named 
        "Best Women's Running Shoe" and "Best Winter Running Shoe" by publications including Runner's World
        and Sports Illustrated.The company has been recognized for environmental sustainability programs and technical 
        innovation.
